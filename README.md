# Try icestorm flow on ice40up5k FPGA

This project is based on the [iCESugar](https://www.muselab-tech.com/wan-quan-shi-yong-kai-yuan-gong-ju-lian-de-fpgadan-ban/) board, using fully open source Verilog-to-Bitstream toolchain(yosys, nextpnr and icestorm).

## Hardware

See [ICESugar](https://github.com/wuxx/icesugar/blob/master/README_en.md) for more details.

## Development environment setup

See [http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/](http://www.clifford.at/icestorm/) for installing the toolchain.

For archlinux, just install icestorm-git, nextpnr-git and yosys-git from the Arch User Repository.
